## ✏️ Description

**Score Domino** is a simple app designed to calculate scores for domino matches, developed to simplify point counting and replace the use of beans and corn. The idea came after watching my family play and use small objects for scoring, which often led to confusion and complaints. I decided to create a digital solution to make this experience more practical and organized.

It was a great opportunity to apply my knowledge in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS while studying to re-enter the front-end market, resulting in a useful tool for my family and others who want to enjoy the game without using physical objects or scorecards.
